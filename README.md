# BOOK LIB :books:
___

**BOOK LIB** is a simple book logger that keeps track of all the books you add to it. It is built with _HTML_, _CSS_ and _JavaScript_ and it uses local storage to persist the data.

This was an interesting project to build because I learnt so much about JavaScript array methods. The biggest challenge was to get the **id** of the book the user has clicked on and then delete that book from local storage.

Let me know what you think :smile:
